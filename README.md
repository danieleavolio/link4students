Link 4 Student is a project based on [Svelte-Kit]('https://kit.svelte.dev/') and [Firebase]('https://firebase.google.com/') for my Computer Science Thesis

## How to use

To run the project, you can run this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Note: the you need `firebase` installed in your machine to use that.


## Used Technologies
For this project I used plain `CSS` to style the entire project.
The `back-end` is entirely in `Firebase` to handle data and real-time updates on certain objects. The `front-end` is made with `Svelte-kit`; it is a framework for building extremely high-performance web apps.
